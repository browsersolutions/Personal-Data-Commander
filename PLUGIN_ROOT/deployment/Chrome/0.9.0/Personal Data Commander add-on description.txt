While surfing the web on mobile devices you pay for the amount of data transmitted to and from your browser. By eliminating calls to advertising and data harvesting networks 
this extension conserves your precious bandwidth for your own direct use. You can save money on the data package in you mobile phone bill with this extension.

An added bonus is that this data conservation will at the same time also make your browsing faster.

Using cookies for tracking your every move across the internet is somewhat old-fashioned. Now the tracking is embedded into the web links themselves. 
This extension removes some of the most common tracking tags - to free you from the tight embrace of targeted manipulation by websites. 

This extension is NOT an ad-blocker. No advertising directed by a website to your browser will be altered or supressed in anyway by this extension. 
There are many excellent adblockers available. This is not one of them. It is a usefull supplement to an ad-blocker, but not a replacement. 

No advertising is presented by this extension. No user or usage data is collected or retained. 

The extension is written in the new Manifest V3 format advanced by Google/Chrome and is therefore future-proof in the near-to-medium term. 
Likewise it is written without any javascript to safeguard the security and privacy of the user. It contains no code that can be subverted by others.

At present (Nov. 2023) this extension is in early release. Later versions will include a GUI with which the user can directly control (view/add/edit/delete) the rules and policies according to which it operates.
