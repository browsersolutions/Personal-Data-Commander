## Reporting a Vulnerability

The product has not had  a proper security review yet. There are a number of issues outstading, 
as is to be expected in a product this early in development. 

See commens in the code for some of them. There are many more. 
A partial list will be added here later. 

Ammend this file as and when anything new is discovered.
